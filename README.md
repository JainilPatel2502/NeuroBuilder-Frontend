# 🧠 Neuro Builder

An **AI-powered GUI tool** that allows users to **design, train, and monitor neural networks** without writing code.

With **Neuro Builder**, you bring your own preprocessed dataset, define the problem type (classification or regression), and interactively design a neural network using a simple playground interface. Training runs in real-time with live logs and performance tracking.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Upload Dataset** – Provide a preprocessed dataset (numerical, categorical encoded, or normalized).
2. **Select Task** – Choose **Classification** or **Regression**.
3. **Design Model** – Use the neural network playground to define architecture.
4. **Train** – Start training and watch live logs update in real-time.
5. **Evaluate** – Check performance metrics (accuracy, MSE, etc.).
